# Energy drink API

In this workshop we look at how to create an API that keeps track of energy drink consumption.

The API should be able to do a few things:

* return which energy drinks can be consumed
* return a list of all the days of the week - ordered by Monday to Sunday
* return which energy drinks are consumed for a given day of the week
* return which day of the week the most energy drinks are consumed
* return which energy drink is the most popular
* return a list of all the week days and how much energy drinks are consumed for each day
* return how many of a given energy drink were consumed on a given day
* return how many of a given energy drink were consumed for a selection of days
* return a list of all the enery drink consumed for a given day of the week
* return a list of all the enery drink and how many were consumed for a given day of the week
* record that a given energy drink was drank on a given week day
* create a new energy drink that can be consumed

> **Note:** The API can be extended to return nutritional information for a given drink. Can you go and find this information for us. This would supply very interesting information to our API users.



## API endpoints to start with

We will focus on these API endpoints initially:

* return which energy drinks can be consumed
* return a list of all the days of the week - ordered by Monday to Sunday
* return which energy drinks were consumed for a given day of the week
* record that a given energy drink was drank on a given week day


URL route | HTTP Type | Parameters
--------------|----------|--------|
`/api/energy_drinks` | GET | none |
`/api/days` | GET | none |
`/api/energy_drink` |POST| drink_id & day_id
`/api/energy_drinks/day/:week_day_id` | GET | day_id  

## Database setup

We will use the [CRUD app](http://crud.projectcodex.co/) to get going with the API.

We will need 3 tables. During the workshop we will discuss which fields each table will need.

```
create table energy_drink (

);

create table week_day (

);

create table drinked (

);
```

## Help me 

To find images for our energy drinks - 1 can images only.

## Tools & utilities we will use

* PostgreSQL
* REST Client
* [express.json](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/express/express-json) - to make POST routes work
* [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) - CORS to enable us to call the API from GitHub Pages and beyond


### REST Client

A VS Code plugin we can use to call API endpoints.
